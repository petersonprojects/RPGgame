# Python Terminal RPG Game

### In this project our objectives were to:

1. First take the given code and make it object-oriented
2. Create several objects of the Character class for the hero to fight that have their own unique attributes
3. Create a Shop object which the user can buy, store and use items from
4. Add unique items to the shop which can modify character or enemy attributes
